# Friction-Stir-Welding-of-AA6082-and-predicting-the-ultimate-tensile-strength-using-Ensemble-Learning

Developed by @UpenderKaveti

Joining two metals plays a significant role in an automobile and aerospace industries and it is a challenging job. To overcome the challenges, Friction stir welding is considered as the joining technique in the industries as it is a new and a unique way. The objective of this paper is to give a review about Friction stir welding of AA6082. In addition, ensemble machine learning regression models are developed to predict the ultimate tensile strength of AA6082 by taking rotational speed and welding speed as the input parameters. Ensemble learning approach is adopted as it uses the wisdom of many learning algorithms to achieve better performance by filling in the gaps of learning ability. A comparative study on performance of the Bagging and Boosting models was done to select a best regression model for predicting the target variable.
